    "First, I preprocessed the data in the same way mentioned, in detail, in section 1.1.\n",

    "Since GloVE provides a 50 dimension feature vector for each word, I figured that a good way to vectorize reviews would be to average all the words within the reviews. I thought it best to use the average of all the feature vectors in order to standardize the input data based on varying input feature length. By simply summing and concatenating feature vectors, discrepancies in length are not handled properly. After averaging all the values, I felt that it was relevant to weigh the feature vectors by multiplying the feature vectors by the TF-IDF weight, calculated using sklearn's TfidfVectorizer(). This time, each feature vector has 50 dimensions instead of 3414, due to the limit in dimensionality of the word embedding dataset being used."
